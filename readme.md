Simple app to collaborate with multiple people in the same household on a shopping list and choose this weeks recipes

The application uses both the Streamlit framework and Deta Base to supply the functionality.

Feel free to ask me any questions!

Current functionality:
-Weekdates will automatically change as the date changes
-Enter items based on categories. Commas can be used to separate the items
-Click items already on the list to remove them

-Add recipes from the list to the current week with a click
-See the added recipe's instructions and ingredients
-Add the ingredients to the shopping list for that week
-Send the recipe back to the recipe list
-Create your own recipes that will be autoformatted and can be used just the same as the ones already on the list
